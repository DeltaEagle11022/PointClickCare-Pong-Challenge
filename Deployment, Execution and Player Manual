Testing

Testing for this game was done in Jasmine (a JavaScript Testing Framework).
To view test case file, visit my-project/jasmine/jasmine-standalone/spec/Pong_GameSpec.js.
To run test cases, under my-project/jasmine/jasmine-standalone/spec, double-click SpecRunner.html.
  
  Note: Test cases do pass, and one case is intentionally meant to fail to show the working of framework,
  however, due to an issue with getContext("2d") for the canvas, a type error is shown for which a solution is still being found.
  Regardless, the testing is not impeded.
